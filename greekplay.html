    <h1>Gayathri Netapalli presents a Greek play by Sophocles.</h1>

<h4> Play name - The Seven Plays in English Verse</h4>
<h4>Author - Sophocles</h4>
<h5>CH.</h5> <p>(_looking at_ CLYTEMNESTRA).</p>
    <p>I see her fuming with fresh wrath: the thought
    Of justice enters not her bosom now. 
CLY. What thought of justice should be mine for her,
Who at her age can so insult a mother?
Will shame withhold her from the wildest deed?</p>

<h5>EL.</h5><p> Not unashamed, assure thee, I stand here,
Little as thou mayest deem it. Well I feel
My acts untimely and my words unmeet.
But your hostility and treatment force me
Against my disposition to this course.
Harsh ways are taught by harshness.</p>

<h5>CLY.</h5>                              <p>Brazen thing!
Too true it is that words and deeds of mine
Are evermore informing thy harsh tongue.</p> 

<h5>EL.</h5><p>The shame is yours, because the deeds are yours.
My words are but their issue and effect.</p> 

<h5>CLY.</h5> <p>By sovereign Artemis, whom still I serve,
You'll rue this boldness when Aegisthus comes.</p> 

<h5>EL.</h5> <p>See now, your anger bears you off, and ne'er
Will let you listen, though you gave me leave.</p> 

<h5>CLY.</h5> <p>Must I not even sacrifice in peace
From your harsh clamour, when you've had your say?</p> 

<h5>EL.</h5> <p>I have done. I check thee not. Go, sacrifice!
Accuse not me of hindering piety.</p> 

<h5>CLY.</h5><p>(_to an attendant_).</p>
<p>Then lift for me those fruitful offerings,
While to Apollo, before whom we stand,
I raise my supplication for release
From doubts and fears that shake my bosom now.
And, O defender of our house! attend
My secret utterance. No friendly ear
Is that which hearkens for my voice. My thought
Must not be blazoned with her standing by,
Lest through her envious and wide-babbling tongue
She fill the city full of wild surmise.
List, then, as I shall speak: and grant the dreams
Whose two-fold apparition I to-night
Have seen, if good their bodement, be fulfilled:
If hostile, turn their influence on my foes.
And yield not them their wish that would by guile
Thrust me from this high fortune, but vouchsafe
That ever thus exempt from harms I rule
The Atridae's home and kingdom, in full life,
Partaking with the friends I live with now
All fair prosperity, and with my children,
Save those who hate and vex me bitterly.
Lykeian Phoebus, favourably hear
My prayer, and grant to all of us our need!
More is there, which, though I be silent here,
A God should understand. No secret thing
Is hidden from the all-seeing sons of Heaven.</p> 

_Enter the_ Old Man.

<h5>OLD M.</h5><p>Kind dames and damsels, may I clearly know
If these be King Aegisthus' palace-halls?</p> 

<h5>CH.</h5> <p>They are, sir; you yourself have guessed aright.</p> 

<h5>OLD M.</h5><p>May I guess further that in yonder dame
I see his queen? She looks right royally.</p> 

<h5>CH.</h5><p>'Tis she,--no other,--whom your eyes behold.</p> 

<h5>OLD M.</h5><p>Princess, all hail! To thee and to thy spouse
I come with words of gladness from a friend.</p> 

<h5>CLY.</h5> <p>That auspice I accept. But I would first
Learn from thee who of men hath sent thee forth?</p> 

<h5>OLD M.</h5><p>Phanoteus the Phocian, with a charge of weight.</p> 

<h5>CLY.</h5> <p>Declare it, stranger. Coming from a friend,
Thou bring'st us friendly tidings, I feel sure.</p> 

<h5>OLD M.</h5> <p>Orestes' death. Ye have the sum in brief.</p> 

<h5>EL.</h5> <p>Ah me! undone! This day hath ruined me.</p> 

<h5>CLY.</h5><p>What? Let me hear again. Regard her not.</p> 

<h5>OLD M.</h5><p>Again I say it, Orestes is no more.</p> 

<h5>EL.</h5><p> Undone! undone! Farewell to life and hope!</p>
